# Karlo-v1.0.alpha on COYO-100M and CC15M

Karlo is a text-conditional image generation model based on OpenAI's unCLIP architecture with the improvement over the standard super-resolution model from 64px to 256px, recovering high-frequency details only in the small number of denoising steps.

## Model Architecture

### Overview
Karlo is a text-conditional diffusion model based on unCLIP, composed of prior, decoder, and super-resolution modules. In this repository, we include the improved version of the standard super-resolution module for upscaling 64px to 256px only in 7 reverse steps, as illustrated in the figure below:

<p float="left">
  <img src="/assets/improved_sr_arch.jpg"/>
</p>

In specific, the standard SR module trained by DDPM objective upscales 64px to 256px in the first 6 denoising steps based on the respacing technique. Then, the additional fine-tuned SR module trained by [VQ-GAN](https://compvis.github.io/taming-transformers/)-style loss performs the final reverse step to recover high-frequency details. We observe that this approach is very effective to upscale the low-resolution in a small number of reverse steps.

### Details
We train all components from scratch on 115M image-text pairs including COYO-100M, CC3M, and CC12M. In the case of Prior and Decoder, we use ViT-L/14 provided by OpenAIâ€™s [CLIP repository](https://github.com/openai/CLIP). Unlike the original implementation of unCLIP, we replace the trainable transformer in the decoder into the text encoder in ViT-L/14 for efficiency. In the case of the SR module, we first train the model using the DDPM objective in 1M steps, followed by additional 234K steps to fine-tune the additional component. The table below summarizes the important statistics of our components:

| | Prior | Decoder | SR |
|:------|----:|----:|----:|
| CLIP | ViT-L/14 | ViT-L/14 | - |
| #param | 1B | 900M | 700M + 700M |
| #optimization steps | 1M | 1M | 1M + 0.2M |
| #sampling steps | 25 | 50 (default), 25 (fast) | 7 |

In the checkpoint links, ViT-L-14 is equivalent to the original version, but we include it for convenience. We also remark that ViT-L-14-stats is required to normalize the outputs of the prior module.

### Evaluation
We quantitatively measure the performance of Karlo-v1.0.alpha in the validation split of CC3M and MS-COCO. The table below presents CLIP-score and FID. To measure FID, we resize the image of the shorter side to 256px, followed by cropping it at the center. We set classifier-free guidance scales for prior and decoder to 4 and 8 in all cases. We observe that our model achieves reasonable performance even with 25 sampling steps of decoder.

CC3M
| Sampling step | CLIP-s (ViT-B/16) | FID (13k from val)|
|:------|----:|----:|
| Prior (25) + Decoder (25) + SR (7) | 0.3081 | 14.37 |
| Prior (25) + Decoder (50) + SR (7) | 0.3086 | 13.95 |

MS-COCO
| Sampling step | CLIP-s (ViT-B/16) | FID (30k from val)|
|:------|----:|----:|
| Prior (25) + Decoder (25) + SR (7) | 0.3192 | 15.24 |
| Prior (25) + Decoder (50) + SR (7) | 0.3192 | 14.43 |

## ðŸ§¨ Diffusers integration
Our unCLIP implemenetation is officially integrated in the [ðŸ§¨ diffusers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/unclip)
```
#Requisits to run Karlo unCLIP on diffusers
pip install diffusers transformers accelerate safetensors
```

```py
from diffusers import UnCLIPPipeline
import torch

pipe = UnCLIPPipeline.from_pretrained("kakaobrain/karlo-v1-alpha", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
pipe = pipe.to('cuda')

prompt = "a high-resolution photograph of a big red frog on a green leaf."
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]
image.save("./frog.png")
```
Check out the [diffusers docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/unclip) for the full usage of the `unCLIPPipeline`

## Environment Setup
We use a single V100 of 32GB VRAM for sampling under PyTorch >= 1.10 and CUDA >= 11. The following commands install additional python packages and get pretrained model checkpoints. Or, you can simply install the package and download the weights via [setup.sh](setup.sh)
- Additional python packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Model checkpoints
```

## Sampling

### Gradio demo (T2I and Image variation)
The following command launches gradio demo for text-to-image generation and image variation. 
We notice that the second run in the gradio is unexpectedly slower than the usual case in PyTorch>=1.12. 
We guess that this happens because launching the cuda kernels takes some time, usually up to 2 minutes. 
Add `--use_bf16` to use `bfloat16` precision to be able to run on one 11GB GPU.
```
python demo/product_demo.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT --root-dir $KARLO_ROOT_DIR [--use_bf16]
```

Samples below are non-cherry picked T2I and image variation examples of random seed 0.
In each case, the first row shows T2I samples and the second shows the image variation samples of the leftmost image in the first row.

### T2I command line example
Here, we include the command line example of T2I. For image variation, you can refer to [karlo/sampler/i2i.py](karlo/sampler/i2i.py) on how to replace the prior into the clip image feature.
Add `--use_bf16` to use `bfloat16` precision to be able to run on one 11GB GPU.
```python
python example.py --root-dir=$KARLO_ROOT_DIR \
                  --prompt="A man with a face of avocado, in the drawing style of Rene Magritte" \
                  --output-dir=$OUTPUT_DIR \
                  --max-bsz=2 \
                  --sampling-type= \
                  --use_bf16
```
